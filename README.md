Description
In this project, we will design an architecture that meets security, availability and scalability requirements and also streamlines deployment and management processes. We will create AWS Route53 for DNS management, Application Load Balancer (ALB) for load distribution, Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically adjust capacity, VPC setup for network isolation, AWS EC2 instances and MySQL for deploying a web application, and many other AWS services to explore the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool Terraform. Additionally, we will take a step further by not just deploying Python-MySQL application, but also containerizing it using Docker. This modernization approach enhances portability and consistency while simplifying management. Moreover, we'll ensure that our application has an online presence with our custom domain.
